After filing your issue, TTS staff should also **e-mail the IT Service Desk at itservicedesk@gsa.gov** with the body of this issue, along with your computer name. You don't need to include detail, but we do need staff to file these.

(To quickly find your computer name (e.g. XCOH2J-1WFVH4), click the Apple icon on the top left of your screen, and select System Preferences from the drop-down menu.  Then click on the "Sharing" icon in the third row from the top.  Your "computer name" will appear in the top-most text field.)
